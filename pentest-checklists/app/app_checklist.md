LMS/LOS Application Penetration Testing Checklist

This checklist provides a comprehensive guide for conducting penetration testing on Learning Management Systems (LMS) or Loan Origination Systems (LOS) applications, focusing on their unique security requirements. It covers role-based access control (RBAC), sensitive data protection, business logic, file uploads, session management, integrations, audit trails, and compliance with regulations like FERPA (for LMS) or GLBA (for LOS). This checklist complements the web, API, server, database, and CI/CD checklists in the repository.

1. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Testing
Objective
Ensure proper segregation of roles (e.g., student/teacher in LMS, applicant/underwriter in LOS) to prevent unauthorized access or privilege escalation.

Test Role Segregation

Verify students cannot access teacher/admin functions (e.g., grading, course creation).
Ensure applicants cannot access underwriter/approver functions (e.g., loan approval).
Test for role enumeration via error messages or response differences.


Test Privilege Escalation

Attempt vertical escalation (e.g., student to teacher, applicant to admin) via parameter tampering (e.g., role=admin).
Test horizontal escalation (e.g., accessing another student’s grades or loan application) via IDOR (e.g., user_id=123 to 124).
Use obfuscation techniques (e.g., Base64-encoded role values, JSON-wrapped parameters).


Test Access to Restricted Endpoints

Attempt forced browsing to restricted endpoints (e.g., /admin/*, /loan/approve).
Test access with low-privilege accounts using custom headers (e.g., X-Role: admin).
Verify RBAC enforces least privilege across all roles.


Test Role Assignment

Check if role assignment during registration/provisioning is secure.
Ensure admins cannot assign unauthorized roles to users.
Test for role persistence after account updates or de-provisioning.



2. Sensitive Data Protection
Objective
Protect sensitive data (e.g., PII, financial data, grades) against exposure or leakage.

Test Data Encryption

Ensure sensitive data (e.g., SSNs, grades, loan amounts) is encrypted at rest (e.g., AES-256) and in transit (TLS 1.2+).
Verify no plaintext storage of sensitive data in databases or logs.
Test for encryption key exposure in application code or configurations.


Test Data Leakage

Check API responses for excessive data exposure (e.g., returning full user profiles).
Inspect logs, error messages, or debug outputs for sensitive data (e.g., credit card numbers, student IDs).
Test for data leakage via cached pages or browser storage (e.g., localStorage).


Test Compliance Requirements

Verify compliance with FERPA (LMS) for student data or GLBA (LOS) for financial data.
Ensure consent mechanisms for data sharing (e.g., course materials, loan terms).
Check for data retention policies and secure deletion of de-provisioned user data.



3. File Upload Testing
Objective
Secure file upload mechanisms (e.g., assignments in LMS, documents in LOS) against malicious uploads or vulnerabilities.

Test File Validation

Verify file type restrictions (e.g., only PDF, DOC for assignments; PDF for loan documents).
Test for malicious file uploads (e.g., .php, .exe, or files with XSS/RCE payloads).
Check for filename sanitization (e.g., prevent right-to-left override like malicious.txt.exe).
Apply obfuscation (e.g., Base64-encoded filenames, embedded payloads in images).


Test File Processing

Ensure uploaded files are scanned for malware using antivirus integration.
Verify file size limits to prevent DoS attacks (e.g., large file uploads).
Test for overwriting existing files or directory traversal (e.g., ../../malicious).


Test File Access

Ensure only authorized users can access uploaded files (e.g., teachers accessing assignments).
Test for unauthorized access via IDOR or URL manipulation.
Verify files are not publicly accessible (e.g., no open S3 buckets).



4. Business Logic Testing
Objective
Identify flaws in LMS/LOS-specific workflows that could be exploited.

Test Workflow Integrity

Test for bypassing course enrollment deadlines in LMS (e.g., manipulating submission timestamps).
Check for unauthorized loan approval in LOS (e.g., skipping verification steps).
Test for manipulation of workflow states (e.g., changing pending to approved).


Test Logic Flaws

Attempt to access restricted course materials or loan details without permission.
Test for negative values in inputs (e.g., negative loan amounts, negative quiz scores).
Verify rate-limiting on critical actions (e.g., multiple loan applications).


Test Race Conditions

Test for time-of-check/time-of-use vulnerabilities (e.g., simultaneous enrollment or loan submissions).
Use tools like Burp Suite’s Turbo Intruder to simulate race conditions.
Check for duplicate resource allocation (e.g., multiple course seats, loan approvals).



5. Session Management Testing
Objective
Ensure secure session handling, especially critical for shared devices in LMS environments.

Test Session Timeout

Verify sessions timeout after inactivity (e.g., 10-15 minutes for LMS, 5 minutes for LOS).
Ensure all tokens are invalidated post-timeout.
Test for session persistence on shared devices (e.g., library computers).


Test Concurrent Sessions

Check restrictions on concurrent logins for the same user.
Verify session invalidation when logging in from a new device.


Test Cookie Security

Ensure cookies have Secure, HttpOnly, and SameSite=Strict attributes.
Test for session fixation by manipulating cookies pre-authentication.
Decode cookies (e.g., Base64, Hex) to check for sensitive data exposure.



6. Integration Testing
Objective
Secure third-party integrations and authentication mechanisms used in LMS/LOS applications.

Test Third-Party Integrations

Verify security of payment gateways (LOS) or Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI) integrations (LMS).
Test for insecure API calls to external services (e.g., unencrypted requests).
Check for exposed API keys or credentials in client-side code.


Test Single Sign-On (SSO)

Validate OAuth or SAML implementations for vulnerabilities (e.g., token leakage, redirect abuse).
Test for weak OAuth flows (e.g., implicit flow exposing tokens in URLs).
Ensure SSO tokens are short-lived and properly validated.


Test WebSocket Integrations

Check for WebSocket misconfigurations (e.g., lack of origin validation).
Test for data exposure or injection via WebSocket channels (e.g., chat features in LMS).



7. Audit Trail Testing
Objective
Ensure all critical actions are logged securely to maintain accountability and traceability.

Test Logging Completeness

Verify all user actions (e.g., grade changes, loan approvals) are logged with timestamps and user IDs.
Check for logging of failed login attempts, role changes, and file uploads.
Ensure logs capture IP addresses and session IDs for traceability.


Test Log Integrity

Test for log tampering (e.g., injecting fake entries via input fields).
Verify logs are stored securely (e.g., encrypted, read-only access).
Ensure logs do not contain sensitive data (e.g., passwords, SSNs).


Test Log Retention

Confirm logs are retained per compliance requirements (e.g., 1 year for FERPA/GLBA).
Test secure deletion of logs after retention period.



8. Compliance Testing
Objective
Ensure the LMS/LOS application meets regulatory requirements.

Test FERPA Compliance (LMS)

Verify student data (e.g., grades, attendance) is protected from unauthorized access.
Ensure parental or student consent for data sharing.
Test for secure data export/import mechanisms.


Test GLBA Compliance (LOS)

Verify financial data (e.g., loan details, SSNs) is encrypted and access-controlled.
Ensure customer consent for data processing and sharing.
Test for secure handling of credit reports or financial documents.


Test GDPR Compliance (if applicable)

Verify user consent for data collection and processing.
Test for right to access, rectify, or delete personal data.
Ensure data breach notification mechanisms are in place.



9. Obfuscation Techniques
Objective
Test the application’s ability to handle obfuscated inputs that may bypass security controls.

Encoding Techniques

Use Base64, URL, ASCII, HTML, Hex, Binary, Octal, or Gzip encoding for payloads.
Apply double encoding (e.g., %252e%252e%252f) or encode special characters.
Test with null bytes (%00), newlines (\r\n), or Unicode characters.


Payload Obfuscation

Mix case in payloads (e.g., <ScRiPt> for XSS, ROLE=ADMIN for RBAC).
Wrap payloads in arrays ([payload]) or JSON objects ({"key":payload}).
Use recursive encoding to bypass regex filters.


Parameter Manipulation

Test parameter tampering with encoded values (e.g., user_id=%31%32%33).
Use malformed headers or parameters to confuse parsers (e.g., X-Role: a%64min).
